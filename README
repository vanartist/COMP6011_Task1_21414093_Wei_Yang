of the dataset to be used for training. In this study,
we use the data under the yolov8_seg_dataset_clean folder,
which should be specified directly in the system environment.

2. yolo_f1 files include the training result of the model.

3. To run the code, please first extract
yolov8_seg_dataset_clean into the project directory.
